sudo fdisk -l
fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
partd, gpard
mount | grep -i mmcblk0p1
cd /media/F493-CE5C
cd

Any SD card larger than 32GB is an SDXC card and has to be formatted with the exFAT filesystem. 

For a brand new SD card, you should:

Partition (Linux command: partd).  Suppose the SD card is on /dev/mmcblk0.
partd does several things. the subcommands are:
 help
 mklabel
 mkpart
 quit
 rescue
 resizepart

mkpart primary fat32 1MiB 100% should do it.
You can use lsblk -p before you partition to find it.

To format a partition:
sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc2
sudo mkfs.fat /dev/sdc1
sudo mkfs -V -t ext3 /dev/sdc1

check for /boot

There are two tools we recommend: gparted from GUI and fdisk-mkfs from CLI.
Now you can mount the file system and read and write it.
