The GY-521 module is a breakout board for the MPU-6050 MEMS 
(Microelectromechanical systems) that features a 3-axis gyroscope, 
a 3-axis accelerometer, a digital motion processor (DMP), and 
a temperature sensor. The digital motion processor can be used 
to process complex algorithms directly on the board. Usually, 
the DMP processes algorithms that turn the raw values from the 
sensors into stable position data. This tutorial gives only a 
brief introduction to the GY-521/MPU-6050. In particular, it is 
shown how to retrieve the raw sensor values. The sensor values are 
retrieved by using the I2C serial data bus, which requires only 
two wires (SCL and SDA). If you plan to use the full range of 
features or require reliable and stable position data, then I 
recommend to have also a look at ready-to-use libraries. Please 
follow this link to find an excellent library with many 
examples: https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050.
