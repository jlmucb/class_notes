/*
The I2C API is documented here:
https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/i2c-library/

The init call returns a standard file descriptor.  More detailed configuration
of the interface can be performed using ioctl calls on that descriptor.
See the wiringPi I2C implementation (wiringPi/wiringPiI2C.c) for some examples.
Parameters configurable with ioctl are documented here:
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/i2c/dev-interface

Hardware connections:
This file interfaces with the SparkFun MCP4725 breakout board:
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8736

The board was connected as follows:
(Raspberry Pi)(MCP4725)
GND  -> GND
3.3V -> Vcc
SCL  -> SCL
SDA  -> SDA

An oscilloscope probe was connected to the analog output pin of the MCP4725.

To build this file, I use the command:
>  g++ i2ctest.cpp -lwiringPi

Then to run it, first the I2C kernel module needs to be loaded.  This can be 
done using the GPIO utility.
> gpio load i2c 400
> ./a.out
