Class Description
</font></h2>
<p>
Typically, people do not make a living at cryptography or
cryptanalysis, yet many 
people benefit from a deeper understanding of both.
<p>
Cryptography is virtually the only mechanism for providing confidentiality, 
authentication, privacy and integrity in distributed systems, including
the internet, and systems with radio based communications.  
So cryptography is a basic tool for computer scientists.
<p>
You can&#39t really design a good cryptosystem 
if you don&#39t know how they break. That&#39s what
cryptanalysis is all about.  More importantly, 
it&#39s hard to know how to use cryptosystems properly if 
you don&#39t know how they break and how they are designed. 
<p>
This class will be a hands on study of both cryptography and cryptanalysis
with less focus on theory and more focus on actual practice.
<p>
<p>
We&#39ll cover much of the following (depending on class interest):
<ul>
<li>
Classical ciphers: Enigma, Purple, M-209, SIGABA.
<li>
Random Numbers: Estimates and learning, entropy estimation and 
HMM, independence.
<li>
Block Ciphers: DES, FEAL-4, AES, modes of operation.
related keys, weak keys, integral attacks, 
differential cryptanalysis of DES and FEAL-4, linear cryptanalysis of 
DES and FEAL, cryptanalysis of AES candidates, solving algebraic equations.
<li>
Stream Ciphers: Linear shift registers, non-linear shift registers, RC4,
complexity and Berlekamp-Massey, approximation attacks, correlation, 
immunity, WEP attack.
<li>
Cryptographic hashes and one way functions: Dobbertin&#39s attack on MD4,
Differential Crypto, SHA-0, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3.
<li>
Public Key Schemes: Distribution of primes, factoring, sieves, 
discrete logs, index calculus, Pollard rho, Elliptic curves, 
MOV attacks, reduction techniques, point counting, ECC parameters.
<li>
Protocols and their discontents: TLS, IPSEC, proof of possession, CMS, splicing attacks,
key management and side channel attacks.
<li>
Using cryptography in real systems.
</ul>
<p>
<p>
Required Background: Algorithms, discrete math (probability, 
beginning group theory, 
elementary number theory), linear algebra, and the
ability to program 
(for analysis of cryptosystems).  See me if you have any questions.
</ul>

There is no textbook but I'll post extensive notes.
You can find some references <a href="CryptoReferences.html">here</a>.

Mail
</font></h2>
<p> 
I keep a course mailing list for announcements.  Please send me your 
email address.
If you need to send me an email, please prepend 
the subject line with &quot[CS290]&quot.

Grading
</font></h2>
<p>
The grade will be derived from one take-home exam and a modest
class project covering some aspect 
of cryptography agreed on with the instructor.   There will be homework
but it won&#39t be graded.  However, many of the homework problems can
be expanded into class projects and will be helpful for the take-home exam.
