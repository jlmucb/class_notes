\section {Cyclic Groups}
{\bf Theorem 1:}
If $G= \langle x \rangle $ and $|p^t|=n$.  For $p \ne 2$, $|Aut(G)|$ is cyclic of order $(p-1)p^{t-1}$.
For $p=2$, $|Aut(G)|= 2^{t-1}$;
moreover, it is a direct product of a group generated by an  involution and a cyclic group of order $2^{t-2}$.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:} Suppose $\sigma \in Aut(G)$.  $\sigma(x)= x^r$, so $(p,r)=1$ and the result follows.
If $p \ne 2$, $Aut(G)$ has a unique element of order $p-1$. For $p \ne 2$ $c= 1+p$
has order $p^{t-1}$ and the first sub-result follows.  For $p=2$, let $c=5$.  $c$ has order $2^{t-2}$ and
$-1 \notin \langle c \rangle$ and the second subresult follows.
\end{quote}
{\bf Theorem 2:} $G= \langle x \rangle $ and $|p^t|=n$.  If $p \ne 2, t>1$, $Aut(G)$ has a unique subgroup of order
$p$ generated by by $x \mapsto x^{1+p^{t-1}}$.  If $p=2, t > 2$, there are three subgroups of order $2$ generated by
$x \mapsto x^{-1}$,
$x \mapsto x^{-1 + 2^{t-1}}$, and
$x \mapsto x^{1 + p^{t-1}}$.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:} Follows directly.
\end{quote}
{\bf Theorem 3:} If $G= \langle x \rangle $ and $|p^t|=n$. Let 
$G_1 = \langle x^{p} \rangle$ and
$G_2 = \langle x^{p^{t-1}} \rangle$ so $|G_1| = p^{t-1}$ and $|G_2|=p$. Suppose $\sigma \in Aut(G)$
of order $p$.
If $\sigma$ centralizes $G/G_1$ or $\sigma$ centralizes $G/G_2$, $\sigma = 1$
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}  Suppose $\sigma(x) = x^r$.
If $\sigma$ centralizes $G/G_1$, $r=1+kp$.
If $\sigma$ centralizes $G/G_2$, $p^{t-1}(1-r) = 0 \jmod{p^t}$ and again, $r=1+kp$.  The result follows.
\end{quote}
{\bf Theorem 4:} Suppose $G$ is a $p$-group of order $p^{n+1}$ with a cyclic subgroup of order $p$ then either
$G$ is cyclic or $G= \langle x, y \rangle$ with $|x|=p^n$ and one of the following holds for $y$:
(i) $|y| = p$ and $[x,y]=1$,
(ii) $p > 2$ or $p=2, n>2$ and $y^{-1}x y = x^{1+p^{n-1}}$;
(iii) $p=2$ and $y^{-1}x y = x^{-1}$ [dihedral],
(iv) $p=2$ and $y^{-1}x y = x^{-1 + 2^{n-1}}$ [semi-dihedral], or
(v) $p=2$ and $y^2= x^{2^{n-1}}$, $y^{-1} x y = x^{-1}$ [quaternion].
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}
Let $A= \langle x \rangle$, $|G:A| = p$.  If $A$ is central, $G$ is abelian.  If not, $C(A)=A$.  Let
$G = \langle x, w \rangle$.  $w^p \in C(A)$ so $w^p = x^r$ and $(x^r)^w = x^r$.  Now we examine the
action of $w$ on $\langle x \rangle$.\\
\\
If $x^w = x^{1+ip^{n-1}}$, so $r = ps$.
\end{quote}
{\bf Theorem 5:} Suppose $G$ is a $p$-group and $G$ is not cyclic, dihedral, semi-dihedral or quaternion.  Then
$G$ has a subgroup of type $(p,p)$.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}  Let $A$ be maximal with respect to being normal and cyclic. $|G| \geq p$ and $|A| \geq p$
and $A \ne G$.  If $C(A) > A$, $exists B \subseteq C(A): |B:A| = p$.  $B$ is abelian and non cyclic so it is
of type (i) above, which proves it.  If $C(A)=A$, $G$ acts by conjugation with kernel $C(A)$ and
$G/A \rightarrow Aut(A)$ so we're in cases (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) sp $p=2$, $|A|=2^n$ and
$x \mapsto x^{1+2^n} \notin A$.   Thus $|G:A|=2$ and $G=B$, so we're in (iii), (iv) or (v).
\end{quote}
{\bf Theorem 6:} Suppose $G$ is a $p$-group and ${\mathbb Z}(G/{\mathbb Z}(G))$ is cyclic then $G$ is cyclic,
dihedral, semi-dihedral or quaternion.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}
If $G$ is not cyclic,
dihedral, semi-dihedral or quaternion, $\exists D \lhd G$ of type $(p,p)$. $[G,D] < D$ and $[G,[G,D]] = 1$ and
$ D \subseteq {\mathbb Z}(G/{\mathbb Z}(G))$;
hence ${\mathbb Z}(G/{\mathbb Z}(G))$ is not cyclic.
\end{quote}
{\bf Theorem 7:} Suppose $G$ is a $p$-group and every normal abelian subgroup is cyclic.  Then $G$ is cyclic,
dihedral, semi-dihedral or quaternion.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}
\end{quote}
{\bf Theorem 8:} Suppose $G$ is a $p$-group with exactly one subgroup of order $p$. Then $G$ is cyclic or quaternion.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}
$G$ cannot have a subgroup of type $(p,p)$, so $G$ is cyclic, dihedral, semi-dihedral or quaternion.
Looking at generators and relations only the cyclic and quaternion cases are possible.  If cyclic, we're done.
Let $G = \langle x,y: x^{2^n} =1, y^2 = x^{2^{n-1}}, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \rangle$.  Let $w$ be of order $2$.
If $w \in \langle x \rangle, w = x^{2^{n-1}}$.  If not, $w= x^iy$.
$1 = w^2 x^i y x^i y = x^i y^2 (y^{-1}x^i y)= y^2 = x^{2^{n-1}}$, which is a contradiction.  Thus $G$ has a
unique element of order $2$.
\end{quote}
{\bf Theorem 9:} If $G$ is quaternion of order $8$ then (i) every subgroup is cyclic, (ii) $Aut(G) \cong S_4$,
(iii) an element of order $3$ transitively permutes the $3$ non-central classes of $G$.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}
Let $H < G$, so $|H| \leq 4$.  Since $G$ has a unique element of order $2$ and $H$ is abelian, $H$ is cyclic and
(i) follows.  $G$ has three distinct subgroups of order $4$:
$\langle u \rangle$,
$\langle v \rangle$, and
$\langle w \rangle$. $u^2=v^2=w^2 =z$ and $[u,v] = [w,v] = [u,w] =z$ and
$\langle u, v \rangle = 
\langle u, w \rangle = 
\langle v, w \rangle = G$.  $Sym(u,v,w) \mapsto Aut(G)$.  Further, $Sym(u,v,w) \cap Inn(G) = 1$ since
$\langle u \rangle, \langle v \rangle, \langle w \rangle$ are normal.  But $Inn(u,v,w) \lhd Aut(G)$ and
$|Inn(G)| = 4$.  $Aut(G)$ contains the semi-direct product of $Inn(G)$ and $Sym(u, v, w)$, which is
isomorphic to $S_4$.  Finally, let  $\sigma \in Aut(G)$ have order $3$, $\sigma$ permutes $u,v,w$.
If $\sigma$ fixes one of these, it fixes all of them.  So $\sigma(u)= u u^{-1}$ and same for $v, w$
and the result follows.
\end{quote}
{\bf Theorem 10:} If $G$ is quaternion of order $>8$ then (i) every subgroup is cyclic or quaternion,
(ii) if $N$ is a non-ableian normal subgroup, $|G:N| = 1, 2$,
(iii) $G$ has a characteristic cyclic subgroup, $A$ of index $2$,
$Aut(G)$ is a $2$-group, and,
(iv) $G$ has three conjugacy classes of elements of order $4$, one consists of the two elements of $A$ or order $4$
and the other two consist of half the elements of $G \setminus A$.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}
Since $G$ has a unique element of order $2$, so does every subgroup.
The subgroups are cyclic or quaternion.
$G = \langle x, y: x^{2^n}= 1, y^2= x^{2^{n-1}}, y^{-1} x y = x^{-1} \rangle$.  Let $A = \langle x \rangle$.
Every element of $G \setminus A$ has order $4$.  The generators of $A$ are the only elements of $G$
of order $2^n > 4$ and $A \; char \; G$ giving (i) and (iii).  Suppose $N$ is a normal, non-abelian subgroup
of $G$ and $N$ is not a subgroup of $A$.  Let $w \in N \setminus A$, $w^2 = x^{2^{n-1}}$ and
$w^{-1} x w = x^{-1}$.  Since $N \lhd G$, $N$ contains $[w,x]=x^2$ and $\langle x^2, w \rangle \subseteq N$
of index $2$.  So (ii) follows.
Suppose $Aut(G)$ is not a $2$ group. $\sigma \in Aut(G)$ of prime order coprime to $2$. $\sigma \in Aut(A)$,
but $Aut(A)$ is a $2$-group, so $\sigma$ fixes $A$.  $\exists w \in G: \sigma(w) =w$.
$G = \langle A, w \rangle$; $\sigma$ fixes all of $G$, contradiction and (iv) holds.
$\{ x^{2^{n-2}},x^{-2^{n-2}} \} $ are the elements of $A$ of order $4$.  Let $w \in G \setminus A$,
$x^w = w^{-1}$ and $C(w)= \langle x^{2^{n-1}}, w \rangle = \langle w \rangle$ and the result follows.

\section {Non-cyclic groups}
{\bf Theorem 1:}
If $G= E(p^n)$ then $Aut(G)= L_n(p)$.
\\
\\
{\bf Theorem 2:}
If $G= S_n$ then $Aut(G)= S_n$ if $n \ne 6$ and a covering group with factor $2$ of $S_6$ for
$S_6$ (an outer automorphism).
\\
\\
{\bf Theorem 3:}
If $G$ is simple, $1 \rightarrow G \rightarrow Aut(G)$.
\\
\\
{\bf Definition:} $Q_8 =
\langle
\left(\begin{array} {cc}
i & 0\\
0 & i\\
\end{array}\right),
\left(\begin{array} {cc}
0 & -1\\
1 & 0\\
\end{array}\right),
\left(\begin{array} {cc}
0 & 1\\
-1 & 0\\
\end{array}\right)
\rangle$. $Q_8 \in S_2(SL_2(5))$.
\\
\\
{\bf Theorem 4:}  The automorphism group of $Q_8$ is $S_4$.
\\
\\
{\bf Notation:} Suppose $G$ can be represented as a subgroup of $GL_p(V)$.
Let $\phi_{x}$ be the automorphism induced by $x$ on $V$ in such a representation.
\\
\\
{\bf Theorem 5:} If $H \lhd G \subseteq GL_p(V)$ then $C_V(H)$ is $G$-invariant.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}
Let $w \in W = C_V(G), h \in H, g \in G$ and let $\phi_{x}$ be as above.
$g^{-1} h g \in H$ so $\phi_{g^{-1} h g}(w) = 1$.
so $\phi_{g^{-1}} \phi_{h} \phi_{g} (w) = w$ and so $\phi_{h} \phi_{g} (w) = \phi_{g} (w)$.
Thus $W$ is $G$-invariant.
\end{quote}
{\bf Theorem 6:} Let $P \in p(GL_p(V))$.  $\exists v \in V: \phi_{x}(v)= v, \forall x \in P$.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}
By induction on $|P|$.  Let $M \lhd P$ be maximal so $|P:M|=p$ and put $W=C_V(M)$.
By induction, $W \ne 1$ and is $P$-invariant.  Choose $y \in P \setminus M$ then
$y^p \in M$ so the minimal polynomial for $y$ is $x^p-1 = (x-1)^p$ so there is a $w \in W: [w,y]=1$.
thus $[w, \langle y, M \rangle ] = 1$.
\end{quote}
{\bf Theorem 7:} Let $K \lhd P$ then $K \cap {\mathbb Z}(P) \ne 1$.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}
$H= \Omega_1({\mathbb Z}(K) \ne 1$.  $H \textnormal{ char } K \lhd P$ and $H$ is elementary
abelian. Let ${\overline P} = P C_H(P) / C_H(P)$.  Then $C_H({\overline P}) \ne 1$ by Theorem 7.
So, $1 \ne H \cap {\mathbb Z}(P) \subseteq {\mathbb Z}(P) \cap K$.
\end{quote}
{\bf Note:} Theorem 7 holds if $P$ is nilpotent.
\\
\\
{\bf Theorem 8:}  Let $H$ be an elementary abelian subgroup of $P$ and $x \in N_P(H)$.  Define
$H^{(0)} = H$ and $H^{(i+1)}= [H^{(i)}, x]$ then the minimal polynomial for $x$ is $(x-1)^r$
where $H^{(r)}=1$.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}
Put $\psi_x= \phi_x -1$. $\psi_x(h)$ represents $[h, x]$ and $\psi_x^n(h)$ represents $[h,x,\ldots,x]$.
Since $\phi_x^{p^n} = 1$, $(\phi_x(h) - 1)^r = 0$ for some $r \mid p^n$, wiht $r$ is the least such integer.
\end{quote}
{\bf Theorem 9:} If $G$ has a faithful, irreducible representation over $GF(p)$ then $G$
has no normal $p$ subgroup.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}
Suppose $P \lhd G$.  $W= C_V(\phi_{P}) \ne 1$.  But $\phi$ is irreducible so $W=V$.  $\phi_{P}$
acts trivially on $V$ so $P=1$ since $\phi$ faithful.
