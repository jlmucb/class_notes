\section {N-groups}
{\bf $N$-group:}  Non solvable groups all of whose $2$-local subgroups are solvable.
\\
\\
{\bf Condition Z:}  $N_G(\Omega({\mathbb Z}(S))) \le N_G(S)$ for $S \in S_2(G)$.
\\
\\
{\bf Definition ZN-group:} An $N$-group which satisfies condition Z.
\\
\\
{\bf Recall:}  $M$ is \emph{strongly-embedded} if
$|M|_2 > 1$ and $|M \cap M^g|_2=1, \forall g \in G \setminus M$.  $C_L(O_2(L)) \le O_2(L)$ for all
$2$-locals, $L$.
\\
\\
{\bf Lemma:} Let $G$ be $p$-separable, $p \in \pi(G)$ and $P \in S_p(O_{p', p}(G))$ then
$O_{p'}(G)=1 \rightarrow C_G(O_p(G)) \subseteq O_p(G)$.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Proof:}
Given the definition of $p$-separable, this was proved earlier.
\end{quote}
{\bf Observation:} For an $N$-group, $O_{2'}(L)=1$ for all $2$-locals, $L$.
\\
\\
{\bf Modified $ZN$ Theorem:}  Let $G$ be a $ZN$-group with $O_{2'}(G)=1=O_2(G)$ and $S \in S_2(G)$.
Put
$Z= O^2(G)$, $R= S \cap H$.  One of the following holds:\\
(1) $H$ contains a strongly embedded subgroup (then apply Bender).\\
(2) $R$ is dihedral or semi-dihedral (then apply Gorenstein Walter).\\
(3) $Z \cap R \cong C_2$ and $Z \cap R$ is weakly closed in $R$ with respect to 
$H$ (then apply the $Z^*$ theorem).\\
(4) $\Omega(R)=Z= C_2 \times C_2$ (then apply Goldschmidt).

\end{quote}
{\bf Condition {\cal C}:}  $G$ is of even order and $C(t)$ is solvable $\forall t \in Inv(G)$.
\\
\\
{\bf Condition {\cal S}:}  $G$ is a $ZC$ group, $H=O^2(G)$ and
$S \in S_2(G), Z= \Omega({\mathbb Z}(S)), T= S \cap H \in S_2(H()$.
\\
\\
{\bf Definition:}  Suppose $G$ satisfies ${\cal C}$ and $O_{2'}(C(t)) \ne 1, \forall t \in Inv(G)$
\\
\\
\section{Completeness Results}
{\bf Theorem 1:}  Let $G$ be a $ZC$-group with $O_{2'}(G)=1=O_2(G)$ then case (1), (3) or (4)
of the Modified $ZN$ Theorem holds or $O^2(G) \Omega({\mathbb Z}(S))$ has local characteristic $2$.
\begin{quote}
\end{quote}
{\bf Theorem 2:} Let ${\cal B}$ be the set of maximal Abelian $2$-subgroups of $G$ that contain
an elementary abelian subgroup of rank $3$ then 
$\theta_B: a \mapsto O_{2'}(C_G(a)), a \in \Omega(B)^{\#}$ for $B \in {\cal B}$ is a solvable
signalizer function.  Denote its maximal element as $\theta_B(G)$.

\section{$J(T)$-Components}
{\bf Theorem 3:}  Let $G$ be a $ZN$-group ofl local characteristic $2$ with $O_2(G)=1$ then
$G$ possesses a strongly embedded subgroup or there are two maximal $2$-locals $M_1$ and $M_2$
of $O^2(G)$ such that $M_1 \cong S_2 \cong M_2$ and $M_1 \cap M_2 \in S_2(M_i)$.
